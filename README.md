### Welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Marketing Analyst and Freelance Data Scientist in the Financial sector. Don't let my marketing background fool you! I'm a data junkie at heart that loves nothing more than a stiff cup of coffee and a dirty dataset.

#### A Little About Me

- :dog: I have two amazing dogs - Blue & Ice
- :city_sunset: I currently live in NYC, which never sleeps and apparently neither do I!
