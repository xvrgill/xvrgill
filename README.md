### Welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Marketing Analyst and Freelance Data Scientist in the Financial sector. Don't let my marketing background fool you! I'm a data junkie at heart that loves nothing more than a stiff cup of coffee and a dirty dataset.

#### A Little About Me

- :dog: I have two amazing dogs named Blue & Ice
- :city_sunset: I currently live in NYC, which never sleeps and apparently neither do I!
- :oncoming_automobile: I have an undeniable love for cars. Unfotunately i'm 6'3" so I can't fit into most of my favorites but that's never stopped me from oggling

#### My Github Stats

Most of my work is for firms that I work for which explains my lack of contributions here.

Most of my code here is for brain dumps and prototyping. I'm currently in the process of cleaning it up to better align with production level code that I use for my data science clients :first_quarter_moon_with_face: and data analyst role :necktie:.

I'm actively working on contributing to open source projects in 2022 - please do connect with me if you need contributors to your project!
